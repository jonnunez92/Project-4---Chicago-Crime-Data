## Summary of Findings

After running three different comparisons, here are the results:

1. **Comparing Police Districts**
   - District 8 had the most crime at 527,600 instances
   - District 21 had the least with only 4 instances
  
2. **Crimes Across the Years**
   - Looks like overall crime from 2001 to 2023 has decreased
   - Though some crimes have trended up in contrast to the general trend:
        - 'CONCEALED CARRY LICENSE VIOLATION'
        - 'DECEPTIVE PRACTICES'
        - 'HOMICIDE'
        - 'HUMAN TRAFFICKING'
        - 'VEHICLE THEFT' (very recently has spiked)
        - 'OBSCENITY'
        - 'STALKING'
        - 'WEAPONS VIOLATION'

3. **Comparing Months**
    - The most crime seems to occur during the Summer months (May to August)
    - The least crime occurs during the Winter months (November to February)
  
    - Some Crimes do seem to *buck the overall trend* (does not create a distinct "hump" during the Summer Months)
        - 'DECEPTIVE PRACTICE'
        - 'NARCOTICS' (has more of a continuous downward trend)
        - 'OBSCENITY'
        - 'OFFENSE INVOLVING CHILDREN'
        - 'RITUALISM' (drops substantially April to July and spikes in August)
